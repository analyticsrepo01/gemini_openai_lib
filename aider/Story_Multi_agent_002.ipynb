But to his surprise, the carrot patch was empty! “The carrots are gone! All gone!” he whimpered, his ears drooping. He raced to Clementine, a sleek tabby cat, who was lounging under a sunflower. “Clementine! The carrots… they’re missing!” Clementine barely lifted her head. “Perhaps you ate them, Barnaby,” she yawned.  Frustrated, Barnaby sought out Horace, the wise old owl who lived in the barn.  “Horace! Someone stole the carrots!” Horace blinked slowly, “Look for clues, young Barnaby. Clues tell a story.” \n",

But not from Farmer John’s boots.” Clementine examined the prints with a skeptical eye. Just then, Rosie the cow ambled over, her bell clanging softly.  “Those look like rabbit tracks,” Rosie mooed gently, after inspecting the markings. Barnaby gasped, “A rabbit stole the carrots!”  Clementine scoffed, “Don’t be ridiculous, Barnaby.  What would a rabbit do with so many carrots?”\n",

A small brown rabbit with a white cottontail sat nibbling on a blade of grass. “You stole the carrots!” Barnaby barked accusingly.  The rabbit, startled, dropped his grass. “I-I didn’t steal anything,” he stammered. “My name is Cotton. I found these carrot tops near my burrow. I thought someone was being kind, leaving them for me.” Clementine, noticing the fear in Cotton’s eyes, nudged Barnaby gently.  “Maybe he’s telling the truth,” she whispered.\n",

A masked bandit of a raccoon sat greedily munching on a carrot, orange juice staining his paws. “Percy!” gasped Cotton. The raccoon, startled, dropped the carrot. “Oh, hey everyone,” Percy mumbled sheepishly, wiping his mouth with his paw.  “These carrots? I just found them… lying around.”  Barnaby glared at Percy. Even Clementine looked unconvinced.  Percy sighed,  “Alright, alright. I was hungry, and the carrots smelled so good...”\n",

After explaining everything, Farmer John smiled. “Well, Percy,” he chuckled, “Next time just ask! I’m always happy to share.”  That evening, under the setting sun, Farmer John, along with his animal friends, enjoyed a delicious feast of fresh vegetables. Percy, his stomach full of carrots, promised never to steal again. He learned that good friends, and a shared feast, were better than any secret snack.\u001b[00m\n",
